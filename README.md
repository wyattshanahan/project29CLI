# project29CLI
A CLI store created for an end-of-term project
This store was built as part of a group final project which required building a Command Line Interface store.

To run this program, you will need the .py files in the repository and an SQL database hosted through XAMPP/MariaDB.

The beginning of the main.py file gives the specifics on what and how to host your example DB.
